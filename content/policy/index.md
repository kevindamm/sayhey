# Policy documentation

I run this site myself for personal use, and I leave it out there for free use
in a simple utility because there are people in this world I'd love to randomly
hear from, and this is one way to put that out there (having sworn off social
networks).

Especially on this little site but on all of my current projects, I'd like
to keep it simple and ad-free, and that means protecting it from abuse and
keeping the operational costs low.  I've chosen to do this with a combination
of Turnstile and some OAuth identity providers (avoiding turnstile if your
address is one I recognize and you've already logged in).

The privacy impact of Turnstile is considered minimal, it does not collect
personal information for ad retargeting like CAPTCHAs do.  You can read the
[privacy policy for Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

For each note you send, you can opt-in to whether you want your name or the
attached audio, or the note itself, to be publicly visible and for how long.
If you're in my contacts I may be notified when you've sent your note
