# System Architecture and Build Guide

Are you curious about how this site was put together?  Interested in building
something similar of your own?  Then let me know!.. because I'm tempted to do a
write-up of all these details, from frontend design to hosting details and
database schema.  Including security, authentication, authorization,
application costs, scalability and operational desiderata.

I have a larger book-shaped project where I cover a lot of the above, but this
site is a good-sized intermediate step which I feel able to tackle (and I've
been taking good notes throughout the construction of this app).
